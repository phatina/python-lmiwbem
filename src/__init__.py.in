lmiwbem - WBEM client bindings for Python.

LMIWBEM is a Python library, which performs CIM operations using CIM-XML
protocol. The library tries to mimic PyWBEM, but does things in different way:

- TOG-Pegasus client's library is used for communication
- lazy evaluation of CIM objects is used
- some minor API was added for performance reasons
